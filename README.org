-----

~rv32-sail~ is a software emulator for a small computer that uses the [[https://risc-v.org][RISC-V]]
instruction set. While other system emulators (such as [[https://www.qemu.org][QEMU]], or [[https://github.com/rems-project/sail-riscv][sail-riscv]]) are
designed to boot systems like Linux or [[https://sel4.systems][seL4]], ~rv32-sail~ is more modest: it
currently is designed to emulate something closer to an advanced
microcontroller. (Think of it as an emulator for a system like the [[https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive1][HiFive1]] --
not the [[https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive-unleashed][HiFive Unleashed]].)

~rv32-sail~ does not just come with the emulator: it's more like a full Software
Development Kit, similar to some embedded microcontroller boards. It also comes
with a handy environment containing a C cross compiler, the emulator, as well as
a robust build system and test suite, and demonstrations. If you want to try
RISC-V assembly programming, write your own simple "bare metal" programs, or
extend the RISC-V instruction set, this might be for you!

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*NOTE*: rv32-sail ships a RISC-V *software emulator*, which is an approximate
representation of the CPU as a sequential software program. It is not
"cycle-accurate" and can not model clocks, digital logic, power or area
consumption of a physical RISC-V CPU in any way! If you want to the Verilog
equivalent of ~rv32-sail~, try [[https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32][picorv32]]!

* Features

- High-level RISC-V ISA emulator, written in [[https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/][Sail]]
  - Clean code is paramount with lots of comments.
  - High-level, type-safe, functional-imperative description of RISC-V.
  - Part hand-written (execution engine), part generated (decoder) at
    compile time.
  - Implements all of the base RV32IM instruction set as well as a select
    amount of CSRs. Machine (M) mode only, no User (U) mode support (yet).
- Robust build system, toolchain, programming environment.
  - Global dependencies (GCC, Haskell, Sail) are provided with *[[https://nixos.org/nix][Nix]]*,
    so every dependency is taken care of for you, *on almost any Linux
    distribution*. Embedded programming toolchain nightmares are over,
    and you never fiddle with prerequisites -- and you can delete
    everything in an instant when you're done.
  - The build system is written using [[https://shakebuild.com][Shake]] -- it's fast
    and highly accurate, meaning you will (hopefully) never get out of
    date builds, broken builds, or build failures due to invalid
    dependency tracking.
  - Designed to be used incrementally and easy for contributors. Most of
    the Nix complexity is completely hidden, and the build system is
    easy as pie to use -- like a normal shell script.
  - Uses GitHub actions for continuous deployment of binary artifacts and
    examples (Docker, WebAssembly). This makes it easy for users to play.
  - When developing, you can download all the programming tools without
    compiling anything at all, thanks to [[https://cachix.org/][Cachix]]!
- Included programming tools
  - GCC 8.x with the RISC-V backend is the primary C toolchain.
  - A firmware shim library called ~libfirm~ provides the basics needed
    for setting up the environment -- initial stack allocation and calling
    your ~main~ function, etc.
  - Includes a very minimal ~libc~ that provides some of the core fundamentals
    for C programming, including basic standard headers, library functions etc.
  - Loads raw ELF binaries that can be booted and executed directly.
- Included demo code
  - Full test firmware based on [[https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32][picorv32]] firmware, and upstream RISC-V assembly
    tests, for basic verification.
  - Benchmarks: both [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhrystone][Dhrystone]] and [[https://www.eembc.org/coremark/][CoreMark]] are built by default.
  - Fun: a full prototype FORTH implementation, based on JonesForth

Note that ~rv32-sail~ is *not* designed to be packaged for Linux distributions,
or used like -- or as an alternative to -- a real emulator such as QEMU. It is
quite slow, and it is designed for correctness and as the basis for software
stack development, with design flexibility in the simulator.

The end goal of this project is to implement a full, robust emulator for an
embedded RISC-V CPU with [[https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/][CHERI extensions]], based on the paper /[[_][CheriRTOS: A
Capability Model for Embedded Devices]]/, as well as an accompanying
capability-first RTOS. (If we want to stir up our wild imaginations, such a
device could be a pure open hardware/FOSS replacement for devices like the
ESP32.)

* Quickstart

If you just want to try out the emulator and the demos at no cost, there are
three easy ways to do it: your Browser, Docker, and a [[https://nixos.org][Nix]] Cache.

** Quickstart: In your browser

As mentioned above, you can run the emulator *[[https://b2.ls0f.pw/file/aseipp/rv32-sail/web/js/index.html][in your browser]]*, right now. This
requires a modern system with support for [[https://webassembly.org][WebAssembly]]. It has a neat retro UX,
using the JavaScript [[https://hterm.org][hterm]] library. This page is automatically updated on every
commit to the ~master~ branch.

This has been tested on recent Chrome (Desktop), and Safari (iOS), though mobile
input is quite glitchy right now. Firefox seems to have a WebAssembly loading
glitch that requires cache purges, and hterm integration problems; I am not sure
what extent this is inherent or just my code.

Note: The WebAssembly build is *very unstable*, moreso than the ordinary
emulator -- so don't be surprised if very basic functionality doesn't work.
Patches to help Sail WebAssembly support, hterm integration, and emscripten
updates are very welcome.

** QuickStart: Docker

There's a *Docker Container* that's automatically compiled and built (using
[[https://github.com/features/actions][GitHub Actions]]) on every commit to the ~master~ branch. You can try the emulator
immediately by running one of the included demos:

#+BEGIN_SRC language
docker run --rm thoughtpolice/rv32-sail:master -e smoke.elf
docker run --rm thoughtpolice/rv32-sail:master -e dhrystone.elf
#+END_SRC

All of the demos in the package (Dhrystone, CoreMark, etc), as well as the smoke
test firmware (~smoke.elf~) are included in the Docker container.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

Note: The ~:master~ tag for the Docker repository is always updated when the
~master~ branch is, etc etc. There is also a tag corresponding to every git
commit, and the Nix package version (e.g. ~1.0~ or ~1.0pre_...~)

The ~:latest~ tag is reserved for stable releases -- there are no stable
releases as of now.
#+END_QUOTE

** QuickStart: Nix with Cachix

There's a *[[https://cachix.org][Cachix]] Cache* containing all the build tools as well as pre-built
copies of the emulator, updated on every commit to the ~master~ branch. Read the
"Building" section below to get started.

* Building

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*NOTE*: You *must** have [[https://nixos.org/nix][the Nix Package Manager]] installed in order to build the
emulator! While you can install Sail and the dependencies yourself, this is the
only supported development method, and the only environment that tests, builds
etc are run with, in the main repository. Should you ignore this, I cannot help
you with any issues, and you should not be surprised if things don't work!

If you are running an x86_64 Linux distribution, using ~systemd~, and capable of
executing ~sudo~ on your machine, then you can do a quick installation easily
from your shell:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ sh <(curl https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
#+END_SRC

(Please read the shell script. All it does is download a tarball and execute an
actual installation script inside, and you can find [[https://github.com/NixOS/nix/tree/master/scripts][the source code for those
scripts]] as well.)

*You must pass the --daemon flag to the installer!* (If you don't, you will not
have sandboxing support enabled in Nix, which could lead to non-reproducible
builds, and other strange build failures.)

This should work on any modern Linux distribution with namespace support and
systemd as the init system. Then you can log back into your user account --
~nix~, ~nix-shell~ and other tools will now be available.

In the future, I hope to also provide static binary distributions containing
the emulator and test firmware, too.
#+END_QUOTE

Currently, the primary way to compile the emulator and firmware is to use the
build system is by simply invoking it directly using the ~bake.hs~ script. This
is designed to be as easy as possible. If you have a recent version of Nix
installed, this will essentially "just work" -- though the first invocation will
take some time (see below).

There is a binary cache available thanks to [[https://cachix.org][Cachix]] which contains copies of all
the build tools and builds from the ~master~ branch. First, as ~root~ or someone
who can ~sudo~, add yourself to ~trusted-users~, and restart the ~nix-daemon~
service:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
grep -q "trusted-users.*$USER" /etc/nix/nix.conf ; \
    [ ! $? -eq 0 ] && echo "trusted-users = root $USER" | sudo tee -a /etc/nix/nix.conf
sudo systemctl restart nix-daemon.service
#+END_SRC

Then you can configure binary caches with a local file in
~$HOME/.config/nix/nix.conf~:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/nix"
cat > "$HOME/.config/nix/nix.conf" <<EOF
substituters = https://cache.nixos.org https://aseipp.cachix.org
trusted-public-keys = cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY= aseipp.cachix.org-1:UaUH2DczaM7ytMZlyuHtpYq8FAziIQnjmGMaB45rvRw=
EOF
#+END_SRC

Now, clone the repository and build everything:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/thoughtpolice/rv32-sail
cd rv32-sail/
nix build --no-link -f release.nix # download cached binaries
./bake -j # do a local build
#+END_SRC

Provided this all works correctly, you won't have to build any toolchains
locally, you can simply download everything on demand, provided you have a few
GB of space free (download sizes are much smaller than that).

If you want to control or invoke the underlying Sail toolchain directly (for
example, to pass different options, or examine the build environment), simply
run ~nix-shell~ instead:

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ nix-shell
...

[nix-shell:~/sail-riscv32]$ sail -v
...

[nix-shell:~/sail-riscv32]$ riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc --version
...
#+END_SRC

Once you're inside ~nix-shell~, you can also run the ~bake~ command, which is an
equivalent method to run the ~bake.hs~ script, with all the same arguments:

#+BEGIN_SRC
[nix-shell:~/sail-riscv32]$ bake -j
Build completed in 0.01s
#+END_SRC

This command is not only shorter to type, but it executes faster than the
"normal" shell script. For iterative development, you may find having an extra
terminal or tmux window where you run ~bake~ quite useful!

* Usage

Once you've built the emulator and test/demo firmware, all of those artifacts
will be available under the ~./build~ directory.

** Running demos and tests

*** Smoke-Test firmware

The self-testing firmware is available under ~./build/t/smoke.elf~, and can
be loaded immediately. At the end, the emulator will spit out some runtime
statistics, as well as a register dump:

#+BEGIN_SRC
./build/cruise -e build/t/smoke.elf

This will:

- Boot up the CPU, and jump to the initial reset vector (~0x00000000~),
  inside of ~src/boot~,
- Jump to the ~main~ entry point defined in ~src/t/firmware/main.S~,
- Run the RISC-V assembly language tests for RV32IM
- Run a demonstration of a Sieve to compute primes,
- Print some timer information (extracted from CSRs)

*** Dhrystone and CoreMark benchmarks

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhrystone][Dhrystone]] and [[https://www.eembc.org/coremark/][CoreMark]] are included as demos; just do:

#+BEGIN_SRC
./build/cruise -e ./build/demos/dhrystone.elf
./build/cruise -e ./build/demos/coremark.elf
#+END_SRC

*** FORTH

An old implementation of Forth I wrote, based on JonesForth, targeting the
HiFive1. It's still incomplete -- try helping out!

#+BEGIN_SRC
./build/cruise -e ./build/demos/forth.elf
#+END_SRC

** Basic emulator options

The three primary options you may use are:

- ~-l~ the cycle limit, which controls how many CPU cycles the emulator will
  execute before yielding. By default, the cycle limit is unlimited and the
  only way to terminate the emulator is through an ~EBREAK~.
- ~-e~ the elf binary to load. Self explanatory.
- ~-C~ the configuration option spec; this allows you to set arbitrary
  integer/boolean values, controlling various CPU options. (See below.)
  
** Emulator configuration options

The emulator has several configuration options which can be set at runtime in
order to control various aspects of the machine's behavior. Notably, this
includes things like disabling certain instruction set features, etc. (These are
hardware configuration settings that take priority over the `MISA` CSR; you can
have a feature enabled and disable it later, etc.)

To get the list of options, invoke the ~cruise~ executable with the
arguments ~-C help~:

#+BEGIN_SRC
./build/cruise -C help
#+END_SRC

** Cleaning up

You can completely delete this directory later at any time if you want to clean
things up, or run ~bake clean~ to have it done for you.

* Source code layout

The primary directories you need to understand are:

- ~./src/mk~, which contains the build system, written in Haskell. This also
  includes the instruction decoder, which generates Sail code at build time
  to parse and pretty-print RISC-V instruction encodings.
- ~./src/spec~, which contains all the Sail code for the specification,
  including the execution engine.
- ~./src/boot~, which contains the initial bootloader shim and reset vector
  setup, written in assembly. (It's contained here so it's easier to find
  and read.)
- ~./src/libfirm~, a simple ~libc~ and bare-metal programming library that
  demos, tests, etc all share and use.
- ~./src/t~, which contains all the tests.
- ~./src/demos~, which contains a bunch of fun demo programs.
- ~./nix~, and ~release.nix~, which contain the Nix code for provisioning
  all the needed tools.

Everything else falls outside the primary raidus of the blast zone.

* Software/Firmware Development

** Programming toolchain support

*** C/C++

The default toolchain is a GCC 8.x RISC-V cross compiler for bare-metal targets
using C.

C++ is currently *not supported*, but this is only due to a few missing runtime
bits inside ~libfirm~. Patches welcome.

-----

LLVM is *not supported*. While the RISC-V LLVM backend continues to be
upstreamed in various pieces, it (to my knowledge) is still quite unstable. In
the future, we should ideally be able to use a copy of the upstream Nix LLVM
package with the RISC-V backend enabled, and have Clang act as a cross compiler
instead.

If adding a fork of LLVM/Clang with RISC-V support using Nix to build it is not
too burdensome, it might be acceptable in the mean time.

-----

In the long run, the plan is to ship fully equipped GCC and Clang RISC-V cross
compilers, with C++ support.

*** Rust

As a result of the incomplete LLVM RISC-V support, Rust is also not supported.

If adding a fork of LLVM/Clang/Rust/ with RISC-V support using Nix to build it
is not too burdensome, it might be acceptable in the mean time.

-----

In the long run, the plan is to find a way to ship a bare metal Rust Nightly
cross compiler, once RISC-V support in LLVM stabilizes.

* Emulator runtime configuration reference

Not Invented Here. In the future this will describe the semantics and use of the
various ~-C~ options for the emulator.

* Hacking the core

I've tried to make contributing easy and streamlined it as much as possible for
contributors.

** Basic high level overview

** Build system shenanigans

The build system is written in Haskell, using the [[https://shakebuild.com][Shake]] library, which is an API
for expressing and designing build systems -- so it's suggested you [[https://shakebuild.com/manual][read the
manual]] to understand how it works.

The core TL;DR is that Shake is a "dynamic" build system unlike Make: rather
than declaring dependencies statically along with a target, you declare a target
and can run arbitrary code, /then/ declare dependencies. Dependencies can be
arbitrary values, not just files, and Shake has very precise dependency tracking
with an array of built-in utilities: support for tracking file contents,
environment variables, tool output, etc.

The end result of these features is that the project-level build system is
nearly magical and very robust, tracks changes to source code and build tools
extremely accurately, is fast to respond to all changes, and easy to use.

Currently, there is a startup penalty paid for running the build system under
~nix-shell~. This will probably be rectified in the future, ideally by
modularizing it a bit more and then compiling an executable, instead.

** Nix nonsense

While Shake is the project-level build system, Nix is the /package-level/ build
system: it's what is used to distribute artifacts to end-users after the build
system has done its job, and also to prepare the environment with all the tools
we need (by running /their/ build systems).

TODO FIXME: describe pinning, etc.

* FAQ

** Why write this?

There is an alternative, [[https://github.com/rems-project/sail-riscv][hand-written RISC-V model]] written in Sail as part of
the [[https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/rems/][REMS Project]]. The REMS design is focusing on a full 64-bit core that can
boot Linux and seL4. My intentions are hopefully more modest, first aiming for
basic RV32 support and possibly some user/supervisor mode support, and, eventual
capability support in the spirit of CHERI (currently there is a [[https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/sail-cheri-mips][CHERI-MIPS]] Sail
model, however; the RISC-V CHERI specification is relatively recent.)

But mainly, I found Sail and the latest version seemed really capable and cool,
so I designed to write this.

** Why is the simulator called "cruise"?

Because you're sailing on a cruise ship.

** Why is the (two level) build system so weird? Why do I need Nix?

Because the problem it's solving is complex. Also, I am lazy, and it's easier to
do this right once than solve it a bunch of times.

In reality, Sail and associated RISC-V tooling is relatively new -- combined
with that, you need external 3rd party dependencies like linksem, ott, lem, Z3,
a cross compiler, etc. This kind of stuff is a nightmare for users to get right
and it's often very easy for them to screw something up along the way (configure
the toolchain wrong, incorrect versions, newer dependencies aren't available in
their distribution, etc). You also often need to manage like 3 package managers
(at minimum) in some weird ritual to do all these things normally.

This makes just doing things like writing firmware and models and getting your
feet wet tedious -- and it makes it especially frustrating for users who want to
try to understand the core ideas behind the project.

Instead, I chose to just do One Big Huge Ritual and sacrifice everything to Nix.
It consumes everything and makes everyone happy. It essentially vendors every
dependency for the project independent of the host Linux system and provides
hermetic builds. It's like Google's [[https://bazel.build][Bazel]], if it were a package manager for
arbitrary software, including things like OPAM, arbitrary C code (Z3), and
Haskell code. The way I've set things up also ensures that everyone -- no matter
what Linux distribution they're running on, whatever time -- should hopefully
get identical results (more or less), making real reproduction and reuse much,
much easier. It will work the same today and tomorrow and the next week every
time (hopefully).

The Haskell side of things is a bit murkier, but basically, Shake is very robust
in the long term and I plan on refining this project for a while, so investing
in a long-term solution with some up-front work is nice. It also comes with a
lot more guarantees and is generally a lot more flexible than Make.

Finally, because Nix sufficiently packages all the necessary dependencies, and
because this is designed to be a platform for testing software rather than
end-user distribution, the use of Haskell is nearly invisible for most users,
which was a prime concern. (If this was a random software project designed for
true end-user packaging/use, like a software library, it would be a different
story.)
